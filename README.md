# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The goal is to build a regression model to predict the price of a used car based on various features like year, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and kilometers driven.

---

## 📌 Objective

To use machine learning techniques to estimate the selling price of used cars and understand which features influence car pricing.

---

## 🗂️ Files Included

- `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` — Full Jupyter Notebook
- `car data.csv` — Used car dataset

---

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Label Encoding of categorical variables (fuel, seller, transmission, etc.)
- Model training using RandomForestRegressor
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Prediction for a new car entry with a sample input
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## ✅ Model Performance

- **R² Score**: ~0.92 (varies with each run)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: Very low (under 1 lakh in most cases)

---

## 💰 Sample Prediction

Predicted price for sample input:  
`[2016, Diesel, 27000 km, Individual, Manual, 1st Owner]` → **₹5.22 Lakhs**

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

- How to process mixed-type (numerical + categorical) datasets
- How to use regression for real-world predictions
- Feature importance understanding from model behavior
